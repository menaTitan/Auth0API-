Postman collections for Auth0 public APIs

This repository tracks the [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) collections for [Auth0's public APIs](https://auth0.com/docs/api/info):

- [Authentication API](https://auth0.com/docs/api/authentication)
- [Management API v2](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2)

Note: The collection for **Management API v2** is generated automatically from (internal) OpenAPI definitions, so there shouldn't be PRs with individual modifications as they would be lost on the next automatic update. If you see something wrong or missing, please create an issue instead to keep track of it.
